This project analyzes one week of point-of-sale (POS) data from a local teriyaki shop to understand what drives revenue and customer traffic patterns using SQL and Excel.

I examined item-level performance and hourly sales trends to identify the most and least sold menu items, peak traffic times, and opportunities to improve sales during slow periods. The analysis focuses on SQL aggregations, window functions, and data visualization techniques to translate raw sales data into insightful business recommendations.

### Key Findings
- Chicken teriyaki was the top-selling item (104 units sold)
- Salad and bottled water had the lowest sales volume
- 6pm was the peak sales hour (59 units sold)
- Opening (10am) and closing (8pm) were the slowest periods of the day
- Targeted promotions during slow hours led to a 20% increase in sales

### Recommendations
- Introduce targeted promotions during low-traffic periods, such as offering a complimentary drink with an entrée purchase
- Use hourly traffic data to inform staffing decisions

### Tools & Skills
Tools: SQL (MySQL), Excel (PivotTables & Charts)
Skills: Data aggregation, window functions, revenue analysis, business analysis, data visualization
